Mozambique in the latest violence to hit the Cabo Delgado region, local sources said Friday.\\n\\nThe bodies, which were cut into pieces, were left in Piqueue village, a local traditional leader told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"People were surprised while sleeping in the forest,\" he said, indicating that the residents had fled the village for fear of being attacked.\\n\\nThe attackers also kidnapped four women, he said.\\n\\nMozambican police declined to comment, but a local army commander confirmed the attack.\\n\\n\"We urge people to stay in villages where they have protection from the police and the military,\" he said.\\n\\nSince October 2017, nearly 200 civilians, troops and police have died in a wave of violence in Cabo Delgado, a gas-rich northern region which borders Tanzania, with President Filipe Nyusi sending in troops to \"neutralise\" the Islamist threat.\\n\\nThis week, several hundred military personnel from 15 countries including the United States, Canada, Kenya and Madagascar completed a training exercise off the northern coast of Mozambique.\\n\\nAn annual maritime exercise, \"Cutlass Express\" aims to improve coordination against the drug smuggling, human trafficking and illegal fishing that allegedly funds extremists in East Africa and the Indian Ocean.\\n\\nBryan Hunt, deputy chief at the US embassy in Maputo, said the United States was ready to assist in quelling the Islamists.\\n\\n\"We are available and would like to help Mozambique fighting insurgent groups,\" Hunt said this week.\\n\\n\"We already have several programmes in the maritime field and we would like to increase the level of cooperation between the two countries.\"\\n\\nThe violence in northern Mozambique has raised concern among US energy firms seeking to drill major gas deposits off the coast.\\n\\nstr/bgs/hmw',\n 'bert_embed_max': tensor([[ 1.2062e+00,  2.0165e+00, -1.0279e+00,  2.2967e+00,  1.0451e+00,\n          -1.6706e+00,  5.5913e-01,

On 5 December, villagers in Nangade District captured and beheaded two alleged insurgents.\\n\\nOn 7 December, residents from the same area captured a 30-year old man whom they claimed had masterminded the recent attacks in that region.\\n\\nSource: BBC Monitoring in English 13 Dec 18',\n   \"Mozambique's Apparent Islamist Insurgency Poses Multiple Threats The apparent Islamist insurgency in Mozambique's northernmost province, Cabo Delgado, had gone quiet - until last Wednesday night's attack in the village of Nagulué in the Macomia district. The village chief was decapitated and mutilated, several villagers were injured and 18 homes destroyed, according to various sources. It was a brutal reminder that Maputo is far from getting this crisis under control.\\n\\nIndependent security analyst Johann Smith warns that 'al-Shabaab' or 'Ansar al-Sunnah' or 'Ahlu Sunnah Wal Jamo' (no one is sure what to call the attackers) is regrouping and that more assaults could occur soon. He suspects that foreigners could for the first time become targets of what has so far been an assault only on local security forces and citizens. He also warns that, having failed to respond in a coherent way, including tackling root causes, Mozambique's government is about to hand over responsibility to a private security company. This could aggravate the problem.\\n\\nOne security source said the L6G security company, owned by Erik Prince, founder of the notorious Blackwater US private security company, is promising to flatten al-Shabaab in three months. This is in exchange for a hefty slice of oil and gas revenues when those large reserves come on stream sometime after 2023. The equally controversial Russian private security company Wagner is bidding against L6G for the contract, the source said.\\n\\nIs Mozambique's apparent Islamist insurgency linked to Tanzania, Kenya and Somalia?\\n\\nThis is all happening against the background of a threat whose nature is not yet fully understood. It manifested itself dramatically on 5 October 2017 when 40 gunmen attacked the town of Mocímboa da Praia in Cabo Delgado, storming three police posts, killing two policemen and stealing guns. Fourteen of the attackers also died.\\n\\nThere have been 49 attacks to date involving Ahlu Sunnah Wal Jamo, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED). Other sources estimate the toll as over 200 deaths, more than half being civilians, and considerable destruction of houses and crops. After initially targeting security forces, the extremists turned on civilians. Several were beheaded.\\n\\nJasmine Opperman of the Terrorism Research & Analysis Consortium more conservatively counts 47 attacks and 173 deaths but believes the phenomenon is underreported so the number of attacks could be over 50. Opperman is also cautious in describing the Cabo Delgado attacks as an 'Islamist insurgency' noting the lack of propaganda or claims of responsibility for attacks.\\n\\n'Extremist religious interpretations ... remain one of several scenarios at play within an environment where organised crime syndicates have a deep-seated footprint as well as socio-economic frustrations,' she says.\\n\\nThere does seem to be a growing consensus that this is an Islamist insurgency. Smith, Mozambican researchers Sheik Saide Habibe, Salvador Forquilha and João Pereira, and Simone Haysom writing for the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime among others, characterise it as such.\\n\\nEven Mozambique's government may be starting to acknowledge the problem. President Filipe Nyusi told the United Nations General Assembly in September that Mozambique was counting on the collaboration of the international community to fight the menace as these 'criminals' were committing 'crimes of a global character', and because non-nationals were involved. This seemed to some like an oblique way of saying 'this is not ordinary crime'.\\n\\nEven Mozambique's government may be starting to acknowledge the problem\\n\\nLast week South Africa's international relations minister Lindiwe Sisulu indirectly confirmed that Nyusi was worried. 'We were very concerned when we heard from the president of Mozambique about the possibility that there might be some extremist activity,' she replied, when asked at a press conference for Pretoria's take on the Cabo Delgado violence.\\n\\nShe said that at the recent Indian Ocean Rim Association ministerial meeting in Durban, 'one of the problems we identified was that the Indian Ocean has a great deal of potential for investment and wealth and development and all of those things, but it carries also with it the potential of easy transfer of some of the activities which are going on in other countries which might not be quite in line with our traditions down south'.\\n\\nThis looked like an indirect reference to what other analysts, like David Bax of ALPS Resilience, contend - that the apparent Islamist insurgency in northern Mozambique is linked across the border into Tanzania and thence to Kenya and Somalia.\\n\\nFew analysts believe that it is part of Somalia's al-Shabaab, saying locals just call it that for convenience. But some, such as Habibe, Forquilha and Pereira, believe that links exist, not least through the training of the Mozambicans elsewhere up the coast.\\n\\nThe absence so far of attacks on foreigners - including the growing number of expatriates gathering in Cabo Delgado to exploit the huge oil and gas reserves - causes some analysts to doubt that this is an Islamist insurgency. Given the anti-Western ideological disposition of Islamist extremists elsewhere, that might have been expected here too. Smith, an on-the-ground analyst familiar with the territory, warns though that that could be the next phase of the insurgency.\\n\\nHeroin, timber, wildlife and ruby trafficking through Cabo Delgado helps fuel the Islamist insurgency\\n\\nAnd the blurred lines between ideological and criminal violence don't bother all analysts. Rather the opposite. In her new report for the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, Haysom argues that the extensive heroin, timber, wildlife and ruby trafficking through Cabo Delgado helps fuel what she characterises as the Islamist insurgency. She and her colleagues mapped trafficking routes along Africa's eastern 'Heroin Coast', in a report for the ENACT organised crime project run by the Institute for Security Studies.\\n\\nShe found that the insurgents derived some of their funding from these illicit activities. More fundamentally, she contends that the Frelimo government is complicit in the trafficking, which makes it less likely to counter it. State corruption also means that nothing is being done to develop this most backward of the country's provinces, increasing the resentment that fuels the insurgency.\\n\\nHaysom concludes that 'the militants are still militarily weak and the violence could still be contained. But if it is handled clumsily, the situation could develop in a direction that sees northern Mozambique become a zone for launching assaults and furthering the aims of criminal networks across the region'.\\n\\nPeter Fabricius, ISS Consultant\",\n   'Mozambique journalist arrested for \\'instigation\\' By BBC Monitoring\\n\\nA Mozambican journalist remains in custody two weeks after he was arrested while reporting on extremist attacks in the northern Cabo Delgado Province, accused of \"instigating the public\", privately-owned news website Verdade has reported. \"Nacedje Community Radio journalist Amade Abubacar has been in custody for two weeks in Macomia, incarcerated at the district command of the police of the republic of Mozambique in Mueda,\" said the news website.\\n\\nIt added that Amade is accused of \"using means of information to instigate the public\", according to the spokesperson of the public prosecutor, Armando Wilson.\\n\\nInitially held at the Mueda military prison, Amade reportedly had a hearing at the Macomia Court before he was moved to the Mueda district command, according to Verdade.\\n\\nAuthorities have refused to give information on the circumstances behind Amade\\'s arrest, leading to criticism from his family and calls for his release from media freedom defenders.\\n\\nThe actual reasons for his arrest still remain unclear but Mozambican newssheet MediaFax has speculated that he could have been arrested for being in contact with alleged terrorists.\\n\\nSource: @Verdade, Maputo, in Portuguese 17 Jan 19',\n   'Separate attacks leave four dead in Mozambique By BBC Monitoring\\n\\nAt least four people have died in the past week as villages in the northern Mozambican village of Cabo Delgado Province continue to experience attacks.

He suspects that foreigners could for the first time become targets of what has so far been an assault only on local security forces and citizens. He also warns that, having failed to respond in a coherent way, including tackling root causes, Mozambique's government is about to hand over responsibility to a private security company. This could aggravate the problem.\\n\\nOne security source said the L6G security company, owned by Erik Prince, founder of the notorious Blackwater US private security company, is promising to flatten al-Shabaab in three months. This is in exchange for a hefty slice of oil and gas revenues when those large reserves come on stream sometime after 2023. The equally controversial Russian private security company Wagner is bidding against L6G for the contract, the source said.\\n\\nIs Mozambique's apparent Islamist insurgency linked to Tanzania, Kenya and Somalia?\\n\\nThis is all happening against the background of a threat whose nature is not yet fully understood. It manifested itself dramatically on 5 October 2017 when 40 gunmen attacked the town of Mocímboa da Praia in Cabo Delgado, storming three police posts, killing two policemen and stealing guns. Fourteen of the attackers also died.\\n\\nThere have been 49 attacks to date involving Ahlu Sunnah Wal Jamo, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED). Other sources estimate the toll as over 200 deaths, more than half being civilians, and considerable destruction of houses and crops. After initially targeting security forces, the extremists turned on civilians. Several were beheaded.\\n\\nJasmine Opperman of the Terrorism Research & Analysis Consortium more conservatively counts 47 attacks and 173 deaths but believes the phenomenon is underreported so the number of attacks could be over 50. Opperman is also cautious in describing the Cabo Delgado attacks as an 'Islamist insurgency' noting the lack of propaganda or claims of responsibility for attacks.\\n\\n'Extremist religious interpretations ... remain one of several scenarios at play within an environment where organised crime syndicates have a deep-seated footprint as well as socio-economic frustrations,' she says.\\n\\nThere does seem to be a growing consensus that this is an Islamist insurgency. Smith, Mozambican researchers Sheik Saide Habibe, Salvador Forquilha and João Pereira, and Simone Haysom writing for the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime among others, characterise it as such.\\n\\nEven Mozambique's government may be starting to acknowledge the problem. President Filipe Nyusi told the United Nations General Assembly in September that Mozambique was counting on the collaboration of the international community to fight the menace as these 'criminals' were committing 'crimes of a global character', and because non-nationals were involved. This seemed to some like an oblique way of saying 'this is not ordinary crime'.\\n\\nEven Mozambique's government may be starting to acknowledge the problem\\n\\nLast week South Africa's international relations minister Lindiwe Sisulu indirectly confirmed that Nyusi was worried. 'We were very concerned when we heard from the president of Mozambique about the possibility that there might be some extremist activity,' she replied, when asked at a press conference for Pretoria's take on the Cabo Delgado violence.\\n\\nShe said that at the recent Indian Ocean Rim Association ministerial meeting in Durban, 'one of the problems we identified was that the Indian Ocean has a great deal of potential for investment and wealth and development and all of those things, but it carries also with it the potential of easy transfer of some of the activities which are going on in other countries which might not be quite in line with our traditions down south'.\\n\\nThis looked like an indirect reference to what other analysts, like David Bax of ALPS Resilience, contend - that the apparent Islamist insurgency in northern Mozambique is linked across the border into Tanzania and thence to Kenya and Somalia.\\n\\nFew analysts believe that it is part of Somalia's al-Shabaab, saying locals just call it that for convenience. But some, such as Habibe, Forquilha and Pereira, believe that links exist, not least through the training of the Mozambicans elsewhere up the coast.\\n\\nThe absence so far of attacks on foreigners - including the growing number of expatriates gathering in Cabo Delgado to exploit the huge oil and gas reserves - causes some analysts to doubt that this is an Islamist insurgency. Given the anti-Western ideological disposition of Islamist extremists elsewhere, that might have been expected here too. Smith, an on-the-ground analyst familiar with the territory, warns though that that could be the next phase of the insurgency.\\n\\nHeroin, timber, wildlife and ruby trafficking through Cabo Delgado helps fuel the Islamist insurgency\\n\\nAnd the blurred lines between ideological and criminal violence don't bother all analysts. Rather the opposite. In her new report for the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, Haysom argues that the extensive heroin, timber, wildlife and ruby trafficking through Cabo Delgado helps fuel what she characterises as the Islamist insurgency. She and her colleagues mapped trafficking routes along Africa's eastern 'Heroin Coast', in a report for the ENACT organised crime project run by the Institute for Security Studies.\\n\\nShe found that the insurgents derived some of their funding from these illicit activities. More fundamentally, she contends that the Frelimo government is complicit in the trafficking, which makes it less likely to counter it. State corruption also means that nothing is being done to develop this most backward of the country's provinces, increasing the resentment that fuels the insurgency.\\n\\nHaysom concludes that 'the militants are still militarily weak and the violence could still be contained. But if it is handled clumsily, the situation could develop in a direction that sees northern Mozambique become a zone for launching assaults and furthering the aims of criminal networks across the region'.\\n\\nPeter Fabricius, ISS Consultant\",\n   'Mozambique journalist arrested for \\'instigation\\' By BBC Monitoring\\n\\nA Mozambican journalist remains in custody two weeks after he was arrested while reporting on extremist attacks in the northern Cabo Delgado Province, accused of \"instigating the public\", privately-owned news website Verdade has reported. \"Nacedje Community Radio journalist Amade Abubacar has been in custody for two weeks in Macomia, incarcerated at the district command of the police of the republic of Mozambique in Mueda,\" said the news website.\\n\\nIt added that Amade is accused of \"using means of information to instigate the public\", according to the spokesperson of the public prosecutor, Armando Wilson.\\n\\nInitially held at the Mueda military prison, Amade reportedly had a hearing at the Macomia Court before he was moved to the Mueda district command, according to Verdade.\\n\\nAuthorities have refused to give information on the circumstances behind Amade\\'s arrest, leading to criticism from his family and calls for his release from media freedom defenders.\\n\\nThe actual reasons for his arrest still remain unclear but Mozambican newssheet MediaFax has speculated that he could have been arrested for being in contact with alleged terrorists.\\n\\nSource: @Verdade, Maputo, in Portuguese 17 Jan 19',\n   '3 Ugandans held over attacks in Mozambique\\'s gas-rich north Mozambican police said Tuesday they had arrested three Ugandans on suspicion of leading attacks in the country\\'s gas-rich Cabo Delgado province which has been rocked by an Islamist insurgency.\\n\\nThe suspects, two men and a woman, were picked up in a forested area on Friday, with police saying their arrest had enabled them to shut down several \"training camps\". \"These are the leaders of the group of criminals who have carried out attacks in Cabo Delgado,\" said Zacarias Nacute, police spokesman for neighbouring Nampula province.\\n\\nThe arrests come as Mozambique struggles to cope with a wave of jihadist attacks that erupted in the north in late 2017, killing more than 100 civilians and scores of police, and threatening government plans to exploit newly-discovered oil and gas reserves.\\n\\nThe violence has also forced thousands out of their homes.\\n\\nPolice said the three suspects confessed to belonging an Al-Shabaab cell in Uganda but had insisted they were only in Mozambique to find their leader, who had been arrested there at an earlier date.\\n\\nSpeaking to reporters while under police guard, one of the suspects called Abdulrahim Faiza said he was involved with Al-Shabaab in Uganda but had not been involved in any attacks in Mozambique.\\n\\n\"I am not part of the groups that have carried out attacks in Cabo Delgado.
